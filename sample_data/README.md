Here is the list of sample data that can be downloaded:

* bpic2016: this folder contains the log that can be downloaded for building the event repository in neo4j, which is created from a BPIC 2016 log file. Note that this data is the conversion of a traditional log file to neo4j as described in [Graph-Based Process Mining](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-72693-5_21). 

* lpg2ocel2023: this folder contains some data that used in [Transforming Event Knowledge Graph to Object-Centric Event Logs: A Comparative Study for Multi-dimensional Process Analysis]() paper. The data are related to the running example and BPIC15 Municipality 1 based on which the loose of inter-log DFGs are discussed.
