# Introduction
This repository stors some data that can be feeded to the transformation algorithm and the output files that the algorithm generates. The input data can be found in the data directory; while, the output data is in the export directory. The input data are the running example and BPIC15 Municipality 1 based on which the loose of inter-log DFGs are discussed. Here, you can find more information about these folders.

* data: this directory contains the csv file of batch export from the neo4j database. As an example, we kept the exported csv file for runningExample.csv.

* export: this directory contains the ocel files, which are the result of transformation. We kept the exported OCEL for runningExample.csv (called runningExample_runningExample.jsonocel).
